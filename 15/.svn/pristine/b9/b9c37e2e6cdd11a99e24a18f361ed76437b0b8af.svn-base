You can opt-out from the extra-vists packages in your Site Options area. If you do, we'll stop serving our apps once the limit is reached.

**What is different about GetSocial to other plugins and tools?**

From the feedback we've been receiving from our thousands of users, people join GetSocial for its design, easy installation and in-depth analytics. Our easy to user interface allows you to install our social media tools with no code required in just seconds, it's that easy. You also gain a simple to read dashboard with social analytics about your website.

**How do I upgrade and pay for GetSocial?**

Upgrading your GetSocial account is quick and easy. On your account, you'll find multiple times our 'Upgrade Plan' call to action buttons.

Clicking on one of these buttons will guide you to our pricing page. Here, you'll be able to perceive the benefits of subscribing to our Starter plan.

After you have decided which plan you want to subscribe to (we recommend the Annual plan as it provides with 2 months free as discount), you just need to click on upgrade and provide your billing details.

**What is the Copy Paste Share Tracking?**

If you imagine the last times you shared something, it's probable that you haven't done so by clicking on a share button. If you're sharing a video to a friend or sending a link via email, you're sharing something and normally that doesn't get measured.

What happens is that you'll have these people being identified as 'direct' traffic to your website. They're not. The Address Bar feature allows you to track dark social sharing, which is sharing via alternative methods such as Copy&Paste, chats and link sharing in general.

**How can I edit color, shape and twitter handle?**

Editing color, shape and twitter handle is a customization available only to our paid users. By activating it, all these configurations become available, improving your conversions, awareness & reach. The features where you can edit these configurations are:

- Horizontal Shares & Follow Bar
- Hello Buddy, the intelligent popup
- Floating Shares & Follow Bar
- Total Shares Bar (Horizontal + Floating)
- Mobile Share & Follow Bar
- Image Sharing
- Reaction Buttons

**Can I hide GetSocial in specific posts / pages?**

Yes you can! When you edit your post/page in the right sidebar you have an option to hide the social horizontal bars ( this does not include the mobile bar ). There’s an article on our knowledge base about this: <a href="http://feedback.getsocial.io/knowledgebase/articles/566541-can-i-exclude-apps-from-specific-pages">Can I exclude apps from specific pages?</a>

**Do I need to sign a long-term contract?**

Absolutely not! There are no contracts. Pay monthly, cancel anytime. There are no initiation fees, cancellation costs, license fees or any other charges. If you no longer wish to use GetSocial, you can cancel at any time. At that point, your paid subscription will last until the end of the current monthly billing cycle.

**What is your refund policy?**

GetSocial services or applications subscriptions, advertising or any other kind of service are non-refundable and GetSocial is not obligated to provide the User a refund at any time. We may, at our discretion, provide credits toward future services or applications subscription, advertising, or any other kind of service charges on a case-by-case basis.
